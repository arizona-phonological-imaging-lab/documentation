Locating Files and Setting up the LinguaView
---
 >LinguaView will not work unless it has __.csv__ files to work with

 + The __.csv__ file contains the coordinates for the traced tongue

 + A __.wav__ file corresponds with these coordinates

 + Click __open__ and locate the __.csv__ files you would like to work with

 > The file names for the __.csv__ file and the __.wav__ files should be matching

 + In the bottom bar of the window, there are four boxes that can be checked

 + Select __Show Linguagram__

 > This contains the ultrasound image and a 3D map of the tongue contours

 + Also select __Show Waveform__ and __Show Spectogram__

 + The __Show Neutral Contours__ box should remain unselected

 > This uses a file type that is not in use anymore so it is very important that it is not selected

 + Click on the file you would like to view first
